## Grading Policy

- **Homework 10%:**
  Individual homework consists of writing a case brief. The case brief is to be handed in before lecture start on 3rd day. Scored based on quality of problem description and analysis in the case brief relative to the example brief provided.

- **Report 40%:**
  Oral presentation of PBL case scored based on Contribution & Impact (10%), Technical Depth & Soundness (20%), Novelty / Creativity (10%), Presentation Delivery & Organization (20%), Evaluation & Validation (20%), Team Work (10%), Q & A Performance and Reflection (10%).

- **Attendance 10%:**
  Attendance (10%), Homework (10%), and the written technical report are individual assessment components, ensuring that each student remains actively engaged and demonstrates personal responsibility for learning.

- **Project work 40%:**
  The project deliverables must include agent system design (chart following UML), test cases with outcomes (document), a reflection on performance relative to a pure Chat-based solution (document), and a demonstration (in class). The chart and documents are to be handed in within one working day after the end of the course (each max one A4 page). The reflection is scored based on demonstrated understanding of why the performance difference occurs. The chart and test cases are scored based on technical quality. Each deliverable scored 1 if handed in/done with acceptable quality before the end of the course. Each student must also submit an individual contribution assessment for his/her group, used to assign merit from group reports. In addition, each student needs to hand in a written technical report detailing the solution built by the group they belonged to within one week after the course ends.

## Code of Conduct for The Course

1. Students must attend all sessions and complete assigned group tasks. Absence for more than one day results in no credit.
2. Each group must submit a written case brief and deliver an oral presentation of the solution to the PBL case on the final day.
3. All code, datasets, and reports must be uploaded to the designated Git repository.
4. Evaluation considers project implementation, quality of the case brief, oral presentation, and teamwork.

## Course Description

Agentic AI and AI Agents represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond static model inference toward systems that can autonomously plan, act, and evaluate within dynamic workflows. Industry demand is rapidly increasing for engineers who understand not only the theoretical foundations of deep learning but also the design and deployment of agentic workflows. In almost all domains these capabilities are becoming essential for innovation, competitiveness, and workforce readiness.

This course investigates Agentic AI theory and applications. Students will learn agent system architecture and deployment of agentic workflows. The course uses problem-based learning (PBL): students form teams to design and execute an intelligent agent project to meet an industry need selected by the team. Cases from different industries are presented, such as healthcare technology, smart manufacturing, marketing/lead generation, and wealth management.

## Course Description (中文)

代理式人工智慧（Agentic AI）與人工智慧代理人（AI Agents）代表了人工智慧領域的一項典範轉移，使人工智慧超越靜態模型推論，邁向能在動態工作流程中自主規劃、執行與評估的系統。

產業界對於具備此能力的工程師需求正迅速增加，不僅要求理解深度學習的理論基礎，亦需掌握代理式工作流程的設計與部署。在幾乎所有領域中，這些能力已成為創新、競爭力與職場所需即戰力的關鍵。

本課程探討代理式人工智慧的理論與應用。學生將學習代理系統架構與代理式工作流程的部署方法。課程採用問題導向學習（PBL）方式：學生分組設計並執行一個智能代理專案，以解決小組所選定的產業需求。課程中將介紹多個產業案例，例如智慧醫療科技、智慧製造、行銷與潛在客戶開發，以及財富管理等。

## The Importance, Cross-Over Disciplinary and Contemporary of The Curriculum

Agentic AI represents a major paradigm shift beyond generative AI, transforming artificial intelligence from static inference to systems capable of autonomous planning, action, and evaluation. Its applications span smart manufacturing, healthcare, fintech, and marketing automation.

This course integrates perspectives from smart healthcare and AI systems engineering, enabling students to acquire cross-disciplinary competencies in data sensing, signal analysis, AI model construction, and intelligent agent workflow design—skills that directly address growing industrial demand for AI-enabled innovation and practice.

The course integrates two modules from the Miin Wu School of Computing (SOC):
1. Let AI Understand Heartbeats: HRV Smart Healthcare Applications
2. AI Agent Basic Workflow Design

## Make-up Class Policy

If this course is suspended due to force majeure factors such as natural disasters, or due to central or local government announcements of class suspension, the instructor shall adjust the course schedule and arrange make-up classes according to the recommended make-up methods based on the situation. If holidays or national holidays are needed for make-up classes, consensus must be reached with all enrolled students before using holidays for make-up sessions.

**Recommended Make-up Methods:**

1. Conduct make-up classes via online instruction.
2. When class suspension is anticipated due to natural disasters (typhoons, extreme heavy rainfall, etc.), it is recommended that instructors proactively accelerate the course schedule or increase class hours in sessions preceding the potential weather warning period.
3. Starting from the day after suspension, extend class dismissal times to make up for delayed progress. If suspension exceeds 1 day, extend class dismissal times after resuming classes, or hold make-up classes on Saturday/Sunday of that week.

Alternative course delivery methods may be adopted, for example: replacing DEMO with exams, reports, or assignments.
