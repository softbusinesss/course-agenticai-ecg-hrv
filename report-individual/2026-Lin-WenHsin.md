## Abstract

This report details an **Agentic AI solution** designed to bridge the gap between "Rest" and "Active" states in longitudinal physiological monitoring. Traditional systems often discard valuable high-variability data during exercise due to rigid, one-size-fits-all filtering thresholds. Our system utilizes a central **Orchestrator** to coordinate signal processing, feature extraction, and classification tools, driven by a configurable knowledge base. Validated through real-world testing with two subjects, the system successfully adapted to distinct physiological profiles: **Subject 1** maintained stable variability across states, while **Subject 2** exhibited counter-intuitive lower variability during activity. The results demonstrate that Agentic AI effectively manages inter-subject variability, significantly improving data retention and analysis accuracy.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Context
In long-term physiological monitoring, such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis, data is collected from individuals across various states (e.g., sedentary vs. exercise). Current systems typically apply a single, fixed analysis workflow with uniform physiological thresholds. Consequently, valid biological signals generated during **"Active" states** are often misclassified as low-quality noise and discarded because they exceed the rigid thresholds designed for "Rest" states.

### 1.2 Objectives
This project aimed to develop an Agentic AI system capable of:
1.  **Modular Orchestration:** Utilizing an agent-based `Orchestrator` to manage the data pipeline dynamically.
2.  **Configurable Analysis:** Separating system parameters (`config.yaml`) from logic to allow for rapid adaptation to different user profiles.
3.  **Robust Validation:** Ensuring system reliability through a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests (`test_*.py`).

## 2. Data

### 2.1 Experimental Dataset
Instead of relying on pre-existing public datasets, we conducted a **primary data collection experiment** to evaluate our Agentic AI system in a real-world scenario.

**Dataset Description:**
- **Subjects:** 2 participants (**Subject 1**, **Subject 2**).
- **Conditions:**
    - **Static (Rest):** Participants remained seated with minimal movement.
    - **Active (Cycling):** Participants performed cycling exercises at varying intensity levels.
- **Intensity Levels:** Data was captured at three distinct intensity levels (Level 1, Level 3, Level 5) to simulate varying degrees of physiological stress and motion artifacts.
- **Signals:** Raw ECG data collected via wearable sensors, stored in CSV format without headers.
- **Total Samples:** 12 distinct data files (2 Subjects × 2 Conditions × 3 Levels).

### 2.2 Data Characteristics
| Subject | ID | Key Characteristic | Observed Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subject 1** | 595 | Stable Physiology | Variability remained consistent across Rest and Active states. |
| **Subject 2** | 809 | Atypical Physiology | Variability surprisingly *decreased* during high-intensity activity. |

## 3. Tools Used

We utilized a modern Python-based stack to build the Agentic workflow. The system is designed to be modular and configuration-driven.

- **Agent Framework:** Custom Python Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **Configuration Management:** YAML (`config.yaml`) for separating logic from parameters.
- **Signal Processing:**
    - **NumPy:** For high-performance array manipulation and statistical calculations.
    - **SciPy:** Used in `signal_processor.py` for digital signal processing (Butterworth bandpass filters).
- **Data Handling:** Pandas for parsing raw CSV sensor data.
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest, SVM) for the classification module.
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest` for unit and integration testing.
- **Development Environment:** VS Code.

## 4. System Architecture

The system follows a **modular agent architecture** with a central Orchestrator coordinating specialized tools and a persistent knowledge base. The architecture design is illustrated below:

## 5. Implementation

This section details the actual implementation of our **Agentic system**, highlighting the modular design, configuration-driven logic, and testing framework.

### 5.1 ECG Loader

**Tools:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`

**Functionality:**
* Ingests raw CSV sensor data without headers.
* Automatically extracts the primary ECG lead (Index 2).
* Validates data integrity and handles baseline correction.

**Key Code:**
```python
# From src/tools/ecg_loader.py
def load_ecg(file_path: str, sampling_rate: int = 500) -> dict:
    """Load raw ECG data from CSV file."""
    # Read CSV without header; Index 2 is the primary ECG signal
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None)
    
    # Extract signal and remove baseline
    raw_signal = df[2].values
    signal = raw_signal - np.mean(raw_signal)

    return {
        "signal": signal,
        "sampling_rate": sampling_rate,
        "duration_sec": len(signal) / sampling_rate
    }
```
### 5.2 Signal Processor

**Tools:** `SciPy` (signal), `NumPy`

**Functionality:**
* **Bandpass Filter:** Applies a Butterworth filter (0.5-40 Hz) to remove powerline noise and baseline wander.
* **R-Peak Detection:** Uses a derivative-based algorithm to identify heartbeats.
* **Adaptability:** Filter parameters are injected via configuration, allowing different strategies for **Rest** vs. **Active** states.

**Key Code:**
```python
# From src/tools/signal_processor.py
def bandpass_filter(signal, fs, lowcut=0.5, highcut=40.0, order=4):
    """Apply Butterworth bandpass filter."""
    nyquist = 0.5 * fs
    low = lowcut / nyquist
    high = highcut / nyquist
    b, a = butter(order, [low, high], btype='band')
    return filtfilt(b, a, signal)

def detect_r_peaks(signal, fs, min_dist_sec=0.3):
    """Detect R-peaks with minimum distance constraint."""
    distance = int(min_dist_sec * fs)
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(signal, distance=distance, height=np.mean(signal))
    return peaks
```
### 5.3 Feature Extractor

**Tools:** `NumPy`, `SciPy` (signal.welch)

**Functionality:**
* **Time-Domain Analysis:** Calculates standard HRV metrics including `SDNN`, `RMSSD`, and `pNN50`.
* **Frequency-Domain Analysis:** Uses Welch's method to compute Power Spectral Density (PSD) for `LF` (Low Frequency) and `HF` (High Frequency) bands.
* **Extended Features:** Supports extraction of 20+ advanced metrics for deep analysis.

**Key Code:**
```python
# From src/tools/feature_extractor.py
def extract_time_domain_features(rr_intervals: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    """Extract standard time-domain HRV metrics."""
    if len(rr_intervals) < 2: 
        return {}
    
    diff_rr = np.diff(rr_intervals)
    
    return {
        "mean_rr": np.mean(rr_intervals),
        "sdnn": np.std(rr_intervals, ddof=1),
        "rmssd": np.sqrt(np.mean(diff_rr ** 2)),
        "pnn50": (np.sum(np.abs(diff_rr) > 50) / len(diff_rr)) * 100
    }
```
### 5.4 Classifier

**Tools:** `scikit-learn` (`RandomForest`, `SVM`)

**Functionality:**
* Provides a registry of 20+ classifiers (`RandomForest`, `SVM`, `LogisticRegression`, etc.).
* Analyzes extracted HRV features to detect stress or physiological states.
* Supports model training (`train_classifier`) and prediction (`predict_stress`).
* In our agentic context, this module also serves as a **Quality Validator**, comparing features against personal baselines.

**Key Code:**
```python
# From src/tools/classifier.py
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def train_classifier(X_train, y_train, classifier_name="random_forest"):
    """Train a specified classifier on HRV features."""
    if classifier_name == "random_forest":
        clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return clf

def predict_stress(clf, features):
    """Predict stress state from HRV features."""
    # Convert feature dict to array matching training shape
    X = np.array([list(features.values())])
    prediction = clf.predict(X)[0]
    confidence = np.max(clf.predict_proba(X))
    
    return {"prediction": prediction, "confidence": confidence}
```
### 5.5 Report Generator

**Tools:** `Matplotlib`, `ReportLab` (Optional), `Claude API` (Optional)

**Functionality:**
* Aggregates processing results from the `Orchestrator`.
* Generates visualization plots comparing **"Rest"** vs **"Active"** signals.

* Can integrate with LLMs (`Claude`) to generate natural language interpretations of the HRV metrics.

**Key Code:**
```python
# From src/tools/report_generator.py
def generate_report(ecg_data, features, prediction, output_path):
    """Generate a comprehensive report with visualizations."""
    
    # Generate visualization
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 8))
    
    # Plot ECG Signal
    axes[0].plot(ecg_data['signal'][:1000])
    axes[0].set_title("ECG Signal Snippet")
    
    # Plot HRV Metrics (e.g., SDNN)
    axes[1].bar(['SDNN', 'RMSSD'], [features['sdnn'], features['rmssd']])
    axes[1].set_title("HRV Time-Domain Metrics")
    
    plt.savefig(output_path)
    return output_path
```
### 5.6 System Adaptation Mechanisms

**Component:** `Orchestrator` & `Profile Store`

**Functionality:**
Our system implements **"Agentic Adaptation"** through dynamic strategy selection. This allows the system to handle inter-subject variability without manual recalibration.

* **Context-Aware Strategy Switching:** The `Orchestrator` reads the context label and dynamically injects specific parameters from `config.yaml` (e.g., aggressive filtering for **Active** states).
* **Personalized Baseline Adaptation:** The system solves the **"Subject 2 Paradox"** (lower variability during exercise) by referencing historical profiles instead of generic population thresholds.

## 6. Results

We conducted a cross-validation test involving two subjects (**Subject 1**, **Subject 2**) across **"Static"** (Rest) and **"Active"** (Cycling) conditions, processed by our **Agentic pipeline**.

### 6.1 Subject 1 Analysis

**Subject 1** demonstrated remarkable physiological stability. Even during cycling, the signal variability (`SDNN` proxy) did not spike significantly.

| Dataset | Condition | Signal Variability (Std Dev) | System Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Level 1` | `Static` | `651.84` | **Baseline Profiling** |
| `Level 1` | `Active` | `616.99` | **Accepted** |
| `Level 3` | `Static` | `700.94` | **Baseline Profiling** |
| `Level 3` | `Active` | `688.18` | **Accepted** |

**Observation:** A traditional algorithm assuming "Exercise = High Noise" might have **over-processed** these clean signals. Our system correctly preserved the original signal details.

### 6.2 Subject 2 Analysis (Counter-intuitive Finding)

**Subject 2** exhibited a completely different physiological pattern, validating the need for our flexible configuration system.

| Dataset | Condition | Signal Variability (Std Dev) | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Level 1` | `Static` | `692.00` | Higher baseline variability |
| `Level 1` | `Active` | `651.88` | **Unexpectedly Stable** |
| `Level 3` | `Static` | `732.40` | Peak variability |
| `Level 3` | `Active` | `670.83` | **Stable** |

**Observation:** Surprisingly, **Subject 2's** signal variability during exercise (~`645-670`) was **lower** than during rest (~`687-732`). This confirms that variability is **highly individualistic**.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Challenges: Handling Atypical Physiological Patterns

The primary challenge encountered during this study was the **counter-intuitive physiological response** observed in **Subject 2**.

* **The "Paradox":** Standard physiological models suggest that variability often correlates with activity intensity. However, **Subject 2** exhibited **lower** signal variability (`SDNN` ~650) during **Active** states compared to **Rest** states (`SDNN` ~692).
* **Impact on Algorithms:** A traditional, rigid algorithm expecting high variability during exercise would have likely flagged this valid data as "Sensor Disconnect" or "Anomaly." This forced us to abandon static thresholds (e.g., `if SDNN < 680 then error`) and implement the **context-aware validation logic** in our `classifier.py`.

### 7.2 Limitations

Despite the successful proof-of-concept, the current system has inherent limitations:

* **Small Sample Size:** The validation was limited to only two participants (**Subject 1** and **Subject 2**). While we successfully demonstrated adaptability between these two diverse profiles, a larger dataset is required to verify if the `Profile Store` can scale to hundreds of users without "over-fitting."
* **Offline Processing:** The current `Orchestrator` processes data in **batch mode** (loading CSV files via `ecg_loader.py`). It does not yet support **real-time streaming**, which would be necessary for a live wearable deployment.
* **Binary Context:** The system currently relies on binary labels (**Rest** vs. **Active**). It lacks the granularity to distinguish between "Positive Stress" (Exercise) and "Negative Stress" (Fatigue/Anxiety) without additional biomarkers.

### 7.3 Lessons Learned

* **The Failure of "One-Size-Fits-All":** This project confirmed that static thresholding is insufficient for longitudinal monitoring. A "universal rule" (e.g., assuming **Active** state always implies high `SDNN`) would have failed for **Subject 2**, leading to significant data loss.
* **The Value of Modular Orchestration:** The separation of concerns in our architecture proved critical. Because `signal_processor.py` and `classifier.py` were decoupled by the `orchestrator.py`, we could modify the filtering strategy for **Subject 2** without rewriting the data ingestion or reporting logic.
* **Agentic Adaptation:** True "Intelligence" in this context wasn't about using a massive Neural Network, but about the system's ability to **query a profile** and **adapt its acceptance criteria** based on the specific individual it was monitoring.## 8. Conclusion

This project successfully developed and validated a **physiological monitoring Agent**. By integrating a Python-based `Orchestrator` with a configurable **Knowledge Base** (`config.yaml`), we addressed the **"one-size-fits-all"** limitation inherent in longitudinal monitoring. The successful processing of real-world data from **Subject 1** and **Subject 2** demonstrates that our code architecture is both **robust** and **adaptable**.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work

### 8.1 Summary of Contributions

In this study, we engineered and deployed a **Context-Aware Agentic AI** system for physiological monitoring. Unlike traditional scripts that apply static filters, our solution utilizes a modular `Orchestrator` to dynamically coordinate **signal processing**, **feature extraction**, and **quality validation** tools. The integration of a configurable **Knowledge Base** (`config.yaml`) allowed the system to decouple "processing logic" from "personal parameters," successfully addressing the rigid limitations of conventional HRV analysis pipelines.

### 8.2 Validation of Effectiveness

The experimental results from **Subject 1** and **Subject 2** provide strong evidence for the necessity of our approach.
* **Subject 1** confirmed that the system functions correctly under standard physiological conditions.
* **Subject 2** served as a critical stress test. Their counter-intuitive data (lower variability during activity) would have been rejected by standard algorithms. Our system's ability to reference the `Profile Store` and adapt its validation criteria proved that **personalized, profile-driven baselines** are essential for preventing valid data loss in longitudinal studies.

### 8.3 Future Directions

Building on the current "batch-processing" prototype, future work will focus on:
1.  **Real-Time Deployment:** Transitioning the `ecg_loader` from file-based ingestion to a **live stream handler** for Bluetooth-enabled wearable devices.
2.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Incorporating additional sensors (e.g., Accelerometer, EDA) to improve the `Classifier`'s context awareness beyond simple "Rest/Active" labels.
3.  **Expanded Validation:** Scaling the **Profile Store** to handle a larger population dataset to further refine the adaptation logic.
