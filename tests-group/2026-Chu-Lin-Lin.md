## Overview

This test suite validates an **agentic, rule-based ECG HRV analysis system**.  
Instead of evaluating machine learning model accuracy, the tests focus on verifying:

- Correct ECG data loading and validation
- Robust signal processing and R-peak detection
- Correct HRV feature extraction
- Proper baseline construction and rule-based evaluation
- Stable end-to-end dataset analysis behavior

The goal of the test suite is to ensure that the system behaves consistently and safely under various signal conditions and dataset configurations.

| Issue                        | Impact                                                  | Notes                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy classifier tests      | Some tests assume model training interfaces             | Classifier module is retained for extensibility but not used in this project |
| Dataset-specific assumptions | Tests may fail if dataset structure differs from config | Ensure dataset follows `person/condition/*.csv` layout                       |
| Very short ECG signals       | HRV features may be invalid                             | Expected behavior (test verifies rejection)                                  |

## Test Results Analysis
### Result Summary

- Core functionality tests passed successfully
- No critical failures affecting baseline evaluation logic

### Warnings Analysis

Several warnings were observed during test execution:

-   **`DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`**: This is a deprecation warning from the Python standard library `dateutil` module. It does not impact the system's functionality but indicates that the usage of `utcfromtimestamp()` will be removed in future Python versions.
-   **`FutureWarning: Class PassiveAggressiveClassifier is deprecated`**: This warning confirms the "Legacy classifier tests" known issue. While the classifier tests passed, `PassiveAggressiveClassifier` is deprecated in `scikit-learn`. The recommendation is to use `SGDClassifier` instead. This does not impact the current rule-based system, as classifier training is outside the project's scope, but highlights a need for future refactoring if ML models are integrated.
-   **`RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in reduce`**: These warnings occurred during `TestValidateEcgData::test_validate_data_with_inf`. This is expected behavior as the test is specifically designed to handle and validate malformed input data containing `inf` values.
-   **`UserWarning: loadtxt: input contained no data`**: This warning originated from `TestECGLoader::test_load_empty_file`. This is also expected, as the test aims to verify the loader's behavior when encountering an empty file.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric                 | Value                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Average unit test time | < 1 second                                          |
| Total test suite time  | ~20 seconds                                         |
| Code coverage          | Focused on agent orchestration and evaluation logic |

### Conclusion

The test suite confirms that the system reliably performs rule-based, agentic ECG evaluation across multiple subjects and conditions.
Within the defined operational boundaries, the system can be used safely for dataset-level physiological assessment without requiring model training.
