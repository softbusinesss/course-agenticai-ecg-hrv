## Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally, yet many individuals struggle to interpret physiological signals (such as ECG data) and fail to connect these biological metrics with actionable lifestyle changes. There is a disconnect between detecting an arrhythmia (like Atrial Fibrillation or PVCs) and understanding specifically how to modify diet and exercise to mitigate risks in daily life.

## Context/Background

- Point 1: The Diagnostic Gap: While ECG (Electrocardiogram) is the gold standard for monitoring heart health, raw ECG data (CSV/waveforms) is unintelligible to laypeople. Specific conditions like Atrial Fibrillation (Afib), Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), and Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) require precise pattern recognition.

- Point 2: The Lifestyle Disconnect: Patients often receive a clinical diagnosis but lack continuous, personalized guidance. Standard advice is often generic (e.g., "exercise more"), whereas specific arrhythmias require tailored protocols (e.g., avoiding high-intensity exercise for VT/VF vs. encouraging moderate aerobic activity for PVCs).

## Analysis

### Root Causes

1. Complexity of Data: Raw time-series data (e.g., from MIT-BIH or PTB datasets) requires advanced signal processing and domain expertise to interpret.

2. Lack of Immediate Feedback: Users rarely know if their current lifestyle (caffeine intake, sleep deprivation) is directly triggering an arrhythmia event.

3.   Generic Health Advice: Non-agentic systems provide "one-size-fits-all" advice rather than adapting to the specific severity (Label S vs. Label V) of the user's condition.

### Constraints

- Clinical Safety: The system must distinguish between manageable conditions (occasional PVC) and life-threatening emergencies (VF) where immediate medical intervention takes precedence over lifestyle advice.

-   Data Quality: Input data (CSV files) may contain noise or varying sampling rates that affect classification accuracy.

### Requirements

- Input Module: Ability to parse ECG CSV files (Time vs. Voltage).

- Detection Model: A trained Machine Learning classifier (e.g., CNN or LSTM) to categorize heartbeats into Normal (N), Supraventricular (S/Afib), or Ventricular (V/PVC/VF).

- Dialogue Engine: An LLM-based interface to translate technical classifications into plain English and actionable advice.

## Proposed Approach (Chat-based)

1. Collect: User manually inputs data...

2. Analyze: AI analyzes based on prompt...

3. Recommend: AI suggests...

## Proposed Approach (Agentic)

An AI agent system could:

1. Collect: The user uploads a CSV file containing their ECG data (e.g., similar to mitbih\_test.csv format).

2. Analyze: The system visualizes the waveform to identify P-QRS-T patterns and uses a classification model to detect anomalies:

&nbsp;	-   P-wave absence/F-waves: Identified as Atrial Fibrillation (Afib).

&nbsp;       - Wide QRS/Shark fin: Identified as Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation (VT/VF).

&nbsp;       -   Early, wide QRS + Pause: Identified as Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC).

3. Recommend: Based on the detected label, the AI chatbot initiates a dialogue:

&nbsp;       -   If PVC: Suggests cutting caffeine, magnesium supplementation, and stress reduction.

&nbsp;   -  If Afib: Emphasizes stroke prevention, observing triggers (alcohol), and moderate exercise.

&nbsp;       -   If VF: Issues an immediate high-priority medical alert.

## Proposed Approach (Agentic)

An AI agent system could operate autonomously to close the loop between data and action:

1. Collect: An "Ingestion Agent" continuously monitors or accepts data batches, automatically preprocessing and normalizing the signal (removing noise/baseline wander).

2. Analyze: A "Diagnostic Agent" runs the classification model. If "VF" is detected, it triggers an "Emergency Protocol" agent. If "PVC" or "Afib" is detected, it logs the frequency and time of day.

3. Act/Recommend: A "Lifestyle Coach Agent" retrieves the user's dietary and activity logs. It cross-references the specific arrhythmia with medical guidelines (e.g., AHA/LITFL) to generate a personalized plan:

&nbsp;       -   Example: "I detected frequent PVCs at 10:00 AM. This correlates with your morning coffee. Let's try switching to decaf tomorrow."

4. Learn: A "Feedback Agent" asks the user how they feel after implementing changes, refining the recommendations over time (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).

## Expected Outcomes

&nbsp;       -   Outcome 1: precise, automated translation of raw CSV data into understandable health insights (Visualizations + Diagnosis).

&nbsp;       -   Outcome 2: Personalized lifestyle prescriptions (Diet/Exercise) that are specifically safe and effective for the detected arrhythmia type.

&nbsp;       -   Outcome 3: Early risk mitigation for stroke (via Afib detection) and sudden cardiac arrest (via VT/VF identification).
