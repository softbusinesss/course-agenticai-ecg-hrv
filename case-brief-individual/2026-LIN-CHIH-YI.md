# Case Brief - my Individual Submission

This folder contains individual case briefs written by each student.

## Requirements

### File Format
- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Naming:** `YYYY-FamilyName-FirstName.md` (ASCII characters only)
- **License:** Include license declaration (CC-BY-4.0 recommended)

### Content Requirements

A case brief is a structured analysis document that:

1. **Identifies a real-world problem** suitable for an AI agent solution
2. **Analyzes the problem** systematically
3. **Proposes an approach** using agentic AI concepts

Your case brief must include:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Clear, descriptive title of the case |
| **Problem Statement/Definition** | What problem are you addressing? Why does it matter? |
| **Context/Background** | Industry context, stakeholders, current solutions, cost |
| **Analysis** | Root cause analysis, constraints, requirements |
| **Proposed Approach/Solution proposal** | How can you solve it using a Chat-based AI, e.g. ChatGPT? How could an AI agent address this problem? |
| **Expected Outcomes** | What would success look like? |
| **References** | Sources cited (if any) |

### Length
- Approximately 1-2 pages (500-1000 words)
- Quality over quantity

## Grading Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem Description | 40% | Clarity, specificity, and relevance of the problem |
| Analysis Quality | 40% | Depth of analysis, logical reasoning, consideration of constraints |
| Proposed Approach | 15% | Feasibility and alignment with agentic AI concepts |
| Writing Quality | 5% | Clear structure, grammar, formatting |

Scoring is relative to the example brief provided by the instructor.

# Case Brief: Automated Patient Triage in Emergency Departments

**Author:** 2026-Example-Student
**License:** CC-BY-4.0

## Problem Statement

Emergency departments (EDs) face increasing patient volumes while maintaining
limited staff. Triage—the process of prioritizing patients by severity—is
critical but time-consuming. Delays in triage can lead to adverse outcomes
for high-acuity patients.

## Context/Background

- Average ED wait times exceed 2 hours in urban hospitals
- Triage nurses spend 5-10 minutes per patient assessment
- Misclassification rates range from 10-30% depending on experience
- Current electronic health record (EHR) systems provide limited decision support

## Analysis

### Root Causes
1. High patient-to-nurse ratios during peak hours
2. Subjective assessment varies by nurse experience
3. Information overload from multiple data sources (vitals, history, symptoms)

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing EHR systems
- Cannot replace clinical judgment (regulatory requirements)
- Must handle edge cases safely (fail-safe design)

### Requirements
- Real-time processing of patient data
- Explainable recommendations (not black-box)
- Continuous learning from outcomes

## Proposed Approach (Chat-based)

A nurse could:
1. **Collect** patient data from multiple sources (vitals monitors, intake forms) and copy-paste them into the chat with a standardised prompt
2. **Analyze** using the inputed data and prompt
3. **Recommend** priority level with explanation
4. **Learn** by updating the standardised prompt based on nurse feedback and patient outcomes

## Proposed Approach (Agentic)

An AI agent system could:
1. **Collect** patient data from multiple sources (vitals monitors, intake forms)
2. **Analyze** using trained models on historical triage outcomes
3. **Recommend** priority level with explanation
4. **Learn** from nurse feedback and patient outcomes

The agent would augment (not replace) nurse decision-making, flagging
high-risk cases for immediate attention.

## Expected Outcomes

- 30% reduction in triage time
- Improved consistency in priority assignment
- Early warning for deteriorating patients
- Reduced cognitive load on triage nurses
