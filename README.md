📘 Agentic AI ECG & HRV Course Repository

Agentic AI Course — ECG & HRV Student Submissions
A curated repository of all student‑submitted materials for the Agentic AI (代理式人工智慧) course focusing on ECG (Electrocardiogram) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis.

This repo contains assignments, reports, code, data, examples, and reflections from individual and group work throughout the course.

🧠 About This Repository

This repository serves as the central collection of student deliverables for the Agentic AI course held at National Cheng Kung University. Participants apply AI and signal processing techniques to ECG and HRV data, submitting case briefs, code, technical reports, and evaluations as part of their coursework.

The content is organized into distinct folders for each submission type, group project, and practical exercise completed during the term.

🚀 Key Concepts
🫀 ECG Signal Analysis

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are electrical recordings of the heart used to extract features like heart rate and beat morphology. Many AI workflows build on ECG preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods seen across open‑source projects in the domain.

📈 HRV (Heart Rate Variability)

HRV is a measure of variation in time between successive heartbeats, often derived from ECG R‑peak intervals. HRV gives insights into autonomic nervous system activity and physiological stress.

This repository reflects real coursework aimed at practical signal processing, statistical analysis, and AI‑assisted insights into ECG/HRV data.

📦 Getting Started

⚠️ Add specific commands/requirements here based on what your course materials use (e.g., Python, R, CLI tools, AI models).
