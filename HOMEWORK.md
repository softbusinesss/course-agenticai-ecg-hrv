Recommended presentations and tutorials, categorized by their focus, with motivations for why they are essential for you.

## **Physiology & Cardiology Fundamentals**

**1. [Cardiovascular Physiology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavVN9rPGWc) (Yale University - BENG 100)**

* **Motivation:** The gold standard for engineers. Professor Saltzman teaches cardiovascular mechanics from a biophysical and fluid dynamics perspective, focusing on pressure-flow relationships. Particularly valuable because it frames cardiovascular biology as a system of pumps and pipes, which is exactly how an engineer should approach the heart.
* **Duration:** ~50:00
* **Key Topics:** Blood flow, vessel resistance, cardiac anatomy, and systemic circulation.

**2. [ECG Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwHCpl22tLU) (Ninja Nerd)**

* **Motivation:** Renowned for making complex medical concepts intuitive. This presentation provides the clinical foundation to understand exactly what each deflection (P, QRS, T) represents.
* **Duration:** ~50:00
* **Key Topics:** Cardiac conduction, 12-lead setup, and normal vs. abnormal intervals.

**3. [The Complete ECG Rhythm Interpretation Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbdntsZYRSU) (ICU Advantage)**

* **Motivation:** Essential for understanding pathology. This super-cut focuses on identifying arrhythmias, ischemia, and infarction—the clinical "signals" you will program algorithms to detect.
* **Duration:** ~1:45:00 (Full Series)
* **Key Topics:** Tachycardia, bradycardia, axis deviation, and localized STEMI detection.

## **Signal Processing: ECG, PPG, & HRV**

**4. [Analyzing the ElectroCardioGram with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyjGCEWU4zY) (PyData London)**

* **Motivation:** Presented by Dr. Emlyn Clay, this is the perfect "bridge" video. It uses the Python scientific stack (SciPy, Matplotlib) to process real ECG signals from PhysioNet.
* **Duration:** ~40:00
* **Key Topics:** Loading h5py/WFDB data, peak detection, and extracting fiducial markers.

**5. [Mastering Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oek8FsJxFU) (MindWare Tech)**

* **Motivation:** HRV is a primary biomarker for autonomic health. This technical webinar covers high-frequency HRV data editing and artifact correction essential for wearables.
* **Duration:** ~90:00
* **Key Topics:** PACs/PVCs identification, signal processing, and time/frequency domain analysis.

**6. [Photoplethysmography (PPG): Origins to Modern Applications**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjM_bvzwwRc)

* **Motivation:** While ECG measures electrical activity, PPG measures blood volume changes. Critical for anyone working on pulse oximetry and wearable heart rate sensors.
* **Duration:** ~12:00
* **Key Topics:** Optical path in tissue, signal processing, and motion artifact removal.

## **Python for Biomedical Data Analysis**

**7. [Biomedical Data Science in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHCqLBpWTM8) (OmicsLogic)**

* **Motivation:** Focuses on the broader ecosystem of biomedical data. Introduces Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy specifically within the context of healthcare datasets.
* **Duration:** ~52:00
* **Key Topics:** Data preprocessing, handling missing medical values, and basic visualization.

**8. [Predicting Cardiovascular Disease: ML Workflow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Op0Z0z6u5w)

* **Motivation:** A hands-on project tutorial that walks through the entire pipeline: exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training models like Random Forest.
* **Duration:** ~45:00
* **Key Topics:** Scikit-learn, feature importance, and model evaluation (AUC-ROC).

**9. [Building an AI-Driven ECG Waveform Analysis Game**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJwBf6pEgfE)

* **Motivation:** A unique look at using Python (Flask) to build interactive tools. Discusses using synthetic data and fuzzy logic for real-time waveform classification.
* **Duration:** ~10:00
* **Key Topics:** Synthetic data, AI integration (GPT-4/Copilot for coding), and frequency analysis.

**10. [Heart Disease Detection Using Python**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kySc5Wg1Gxw)

* **Motivation:** A practical guide to implementing classification algorithms on clinical datasets to understand how biological features correlate with heart health.
* **Duration:** ~37:00
* **Key Topics:** Dataset classification, Python implementation, and model optimization.
